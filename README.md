Open source documentation, hardware and code for a CubeSat

We provide 4 documents for use by other CubeSat teams, 3 of which comprise our "CubeSat Cookbook".

1) CubeSat_Cookbook_Vol_1_Engineering_Guide.pdf (by R. Pierce Smith) is a comprehensive guide to building your own CubeSat at a detailed engineering level, and includes lessons learned from our Cactus-1 mission.

2) CubeSat_Cookbook_Vol_2_Newcomers_Guide.pdf (by Jorge Rodriguez) is designed for newcomers to CubeSats and discusses some of the overarcing concepts including power, mission readiness reviews, and building effective teams.

3) CubeSat_Cookbook_Vol_3_Common_EPS.pdf (by Erik Schroen) walks you through how to design and customize the electrical power system for your specific CubeSat mission (based on lessons learned from Cactus-1).

4) TheHABHandbook.pdf (by Ian Hastings) is a guide for teams starting up High Altitude Balloon projects.  Under Capitol's "Crawl, Walk, Run" philosophy, we highly recommend teams look at flying payloads and components via HAB as an effective way to iteratively improve your designs.

Acknowledgements: The Cactus-1 mission is Capitol Technology University's first CubeSat mission. Our launch opportunity was provided via the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative. The Cactus-1 mission is supported by grants from the Maryland Space Grant Consortium (MDSGC).

5) We also provide Ralph Stormer III's "PuzzleSat" 3D-printable CubeSat structure models.  This is a simple modular system for building CubeSat-spec PC104-size-compliant test frames for 1U, 2U, 3U, and other variants so engineering teams can practice working within the CubeSat size requirements.  Documetation, STL and CAD files, and a photo are provided.  They are also fun for prototyping, and we use them for student payload low altitude tests as well.

6) We also provide our hardware schematics, CAD files, and anxillary data to help jumpstart other teams.  Our hardware on this github repository is released under the CERN Open Hardware License version 1.2.  Credit for the Work should be given to R.P. Smith in terms of authorship.  Individual items will indicate citation/credits as well.  Generally, you can use this to build your own CubeSat, the full license terms are below.

* Cactus-1 contains the files for our specific architecture
* CADD Files contains the Cactus-1 stack and board designs used
* EaglePCBs contains PC104, solar, and other bus panels suitable for modding
